## 📌 What You'll Learn

* Basic number operations in JavaScript.
* How to use the `Math` object for advanced mathematical operations.
* Rounding methods like `Math.round()`, `Math.ceil()`, and `Math.floor()`.
* Common mistakes when handling numbers and rounding.

## 📖 Introduction

JavaScript provides several built-in features to work with numbers. You can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with numbers. The `Math` object provides a set of functions for advanced mathematical operations, such as generating random numbers or calculating square roots. Additionally, handling decimals properly is crucial in JavaScript, and rounding numbers is often needed in real-world applications like displaying prices or measurements.

## ⚙️ Syntax / Examples

### Basic Number Operations

JavaScript provides several operators for mathematical operations:

```js
const a = 10;
const b = 5;

// Addition
console.log(a + b); // Output: 15

// Subtraction
console.log(a - b); // Output: 5

// Multiplication
console.log(a * b); // Output: 50

// Division
console.log(a / b); // Output: 2
```

### The `Math` Object

The `Math` object in JavaScript provides several methods and properties to perform advanced mathematical operations.

#### `Math.random()`

The `Math.random()` method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number between `0` (inclusive) and `1` (exclusive). To generate a random number in a specific range, you can scale and shift the result.

```js
const randomNum = Math.random();
console.log(randomNum); // Output: a random number between 0 and 1
```

#### `Math.max()` and `Math.min()`

The `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` methods return the largest and smallest of the given numbers, respectively.

```js
console.log(Math.max(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 3
console.log(Math.min(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 1
```

#### `Math.pow()`

The `Math.pow()` method returns the base raised to the exponent power. It is equivalent to using the exponentiation operator `**`.

```js
console.log(Math.pow(2, 3)); // Output: 8 (2^3)
```

#### `Math.sqrt()`

The `Math.sqrt()` method returns the square root of a number. It is equivalent to using the exponentiation operator `**` with `0.5`.

```js
console.log(Math.sqrt(16)); // Output: 4
```

### Rounding Methods

JavaScript provides several methods for rounding numbers:

#### `Math.round()`

Rounds a number to the nearest integer. If the decimal part is `0.5` or greater, it rounds up; otherwise, it rounds down.

```js
console.log(Math.round(4.7)); // Output: 5
console.log(Math.round(4.3)); // Output: 4
```

#### `Math.ceil()`

Rounds a number **up** to the nearest integer.

```js
console.log(Math.ceil(4.3)); // Output: 5
console.log(Math.ceil(4.7)); // Output: 5
```

#### `Math.floor()`

Rounds a number **down** to the nearest integer.

```js
console.log(Math.floor(4.7)); // Output: 4
console.log(Math.floor(4.3)); // Output: 4
```

#### `Math.trunc()`

Removes the decimal part of a number, effectively truncating it to an integer. This method does not round the number; it simply removes the decimal part.

```js
console.log(Math.trunc(4.7)); // Output: 4
console.log(Math.trunc(-4.7)); // Output: -4
```

## 🔍 Deep Dive (If applicable)

### Precision and Floating-Point Numbers

JavaScript uses 64-bit floating-point numbers to represent numbers internally. This can sometimes lead to precision issues when working with decimals. For example:

```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2); // Output: 0.30000000000000004
```

To handle such precision issues, you can round the result to a specific number of decimal places. A common approach is to multiply the number by a power of 10, round it, and then divide it back:

```js
console.log(Math.round((0.1 + 0.2) * 100) / 100); // Output: 0.3
```

This approach helps mitigate floating-point errors by multiplying the result, rounding, and then dividing it back to the desired precision.

## 🧪 Practice Tasks

### ✅ Task 1:

Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

```js
function calculate(a, b) {
  return {
    sum: a + b,
    difference: a - b,
    product: a * b,
    quotient: a / b
  };
}
console.log(calculate(10, 5));
```

### ✅ Task 2:

Write a function that generates a random number between a given range (inclusive).

```js
function getRandomNumber(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}
console.log(getRandomNumber(1, 100)); // Output: Random number between 1 and 100
```

### ✅ Task 3:

Write a function that rounds a number to two decimal places.

```js
function roundToTwoDecimals(num) {
  return Math.round(num * 100) / 100;
}
console.log(roundToTwoDecimals(4.56789)); // Output: 4.57
```

## ❗ Common Mistakes

* **Mistake 1**: Misunderstanding the `Math.random()` function.

  * **Why it’s wrong**: `Math.random()` generates a floating-point number between `0` and `1` (excluding 1). To generate numbers in a specific range, you need to adjust the result using math operations.
  * **Correct approach**: Use `Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min` to generate a random number within a specified range.

* **Mistake 2**: Using `Math.round()` for values that need to be truncated.

  * **Why it’s wrong**: `Math.round()` rounds to the nearest integer. If you need to remove the decimal part without rounding, use `Math.trunc()`.
  * **Correct approach**: Use `Math.trunc()` to discard the decimal part.

## 💡 Interview Tips

* In interviews, you may be asked how to handle precision issues with floating-point numbers or how to implement random number generation within a specific range. Make sure to use `Math.floor()` or `Math.ceil()` appropriately.
* Be familiar with the difference between `Math.round()`, `Math.floor()`, and `Math.ceil()`, as interviewers might test you on selecting the correct method for rounding numbers based on specific use cases.
